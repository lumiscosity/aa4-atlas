**AA4 Atlas** is an addon for the [Antique Atlas 4](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas-4) mod which adds a physical atlas item. Much like in the mod it's based on, the atlas is crafted with a **book** and a **compass**. Once in the player's inventory, it can be opened with the usual Antique Atlas hotkey or by right clicking while holding the item. When held, the map will also be visible.

Sharing and exploration progress is still handled by [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) and will continue even if the item is not present. **For instructions on how to share exploration progress, check its mod page.**

The atlas sprite is derived in good faith from the original [Antique Atlas](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas)
and was drawn by Hunternif.
